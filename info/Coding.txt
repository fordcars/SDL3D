-Try to always use std::strings. When you have function taking an std::string, define that as (const string& param) when you don't need to modify the string. This creates a read-only reference to the string. It is faster than passing the string itself, since doing this copies the string.
-Use references or smart pointers instead of pointers.
-Include files only where they are used. In .cpp if they are used there, not in .h (?)
-Normally, a 'file' is the file name before the prefix, and the 'path' is the full file path (including the prefix)
