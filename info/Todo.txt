-Repair stack corruption (got->second? in findObjectTemplate)
-Keep track of shared pointers of ObjectTemplate (still copy object templates when making objects, though)
-Base class entity that handles lighting etc (do tutorial)

-Support events in input and have handleInput() in Game

------------------------------------
-No need of particles, but billboards would be useful for trees, see tutorial 18.
-Lightmaps is when Blender creates static shadows in textures
-BIG! Level editor?!??!?! + list of objects!!!!!! + textures and all of course (in the same file, 1 per object or whatever)

-3d animations: Either vertex shader or CPU for moving vertices
-Do something with v-sync like that the frame rate doesn't drop to 30?

-Update arrays (uniforms and keys) to std::vectors (VS2012 doesn't supprt list initializations {} so I am keeping normal arrays for now)

-Advanced tutorials:
-VBO Indexing
-2D Text (+2d textures)
