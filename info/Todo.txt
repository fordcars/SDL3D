-do UVCoords and else to convert TexturedObject
-Load object

-Use std::vector for loading objects points
-Base class entity that handles lighting etc (do tutorial)

-Support events in input and have handleInput() in Game

-Levels/enemies
-3d animations: Either vertex shader or CPU for moving vertices
-Do something with v-sync like that the frame rate doesn't drop to 30?

Maybe I should of had a Display class? Oh well

-Sometimes stays alive for a while after quitting?

-Update arrays (uniforms and keys) to std::vectors (VS2012 doesn't supprt list initializations {} so I am keeping normal arrays for now)
-Make array for texture loading (with one call)
