- Getting a bunch of undefined references to Lua when linking SDL3D?
Ah ha! You probably did not compile Lua as C++! See Compiling.txt for informtation on how to compile it as C++ according to your system.

If you get a weird crash segfault when starting the engine, it might be because you are using library stuff (like OpenGL) before initializing them!
