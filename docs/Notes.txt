-The shaders are encoded in ASCII (or UTF-8, using the first bits)
-If there are holes in models, click the "invert normals" button in your 3D modeler.

-Models are loaded as objects, not groups (.obj).

-On Linux and Mac, link with -ldl (libdl)

-Only because some libraries are compiled as Release, and not Debug: 'warning LNK4098: defaultlib 'msvcrt.lib' conflicts with use of other libs; use /NODEFAULTLIB:library 2> -SDL3D.vcxproj -> C:\Users\Carl\Desktop\Development\SDL3D\build\Debug\SDL3D.exe'. Compile program as Release to repair this.

-When rendering mincraft scene, we see a lot of filtering artefacts since the textures are very close to each other (we shouldn't be using filtering at all when rendering Minecraft scenes). This has to do with the filtering when generating the mipmaps for the texture.
