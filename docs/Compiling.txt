Lua has to be compiled as C++! See instructions for your platform below.

- To update or recreate the OpenGL Loader, launch glad or go to http://glad.dav1d.de/ (Git: https://github.com/dav1dde/glad-web).
- Include all extensions in the loader :)

- This code uses a number of C++11 features, so make sure your compiler supports them.

- On Linux and Mac, link with -ldl (libdl).

- Compiling as Debug can greatly affect peformance.

Windows VisualStudio:
To compile Lua as C++, run the .bat script at lib/lua/C++CompilingVisualStudio.bat. Then, place the dynamic library (.dll) and the .lib inside the correct folders in lib/lua.

Notes:
- On some VisualStudio versions (example: 2013-2015), compiling in 32-bit, GLM causes an alignment error. To repair this, comment out "#define GLM_HAS_ANONYMOUS_UNION (GLM_LANG & GLM_LANG_CXXMS_FLAG)" at line 675 of glm/detail/setup.hpp.

- On some VisualStudio versions (example: 2015), SDL must be compiled using the same version as the one compiling the game engine. This will fix the unresolved external error. This is because VisualStudio 2015 changed quite a few things.

- Only because some libraries are compiled as Release, and not Debug: 'warning LNK4098: defaultlib 'msvcrt.lib' conflicts with use of other libs; use /NODEFAULTLIB:library 2> -SDL3D.vcxproj -> C:\Users\Carl\Desktop\Development\SDL3D\build\Debug\SDL3D.exe'. Compile program as Release to repair this.

Windows MinGW and MYSYS (not yet supported, this is for future reference!):
To compile Lua as C++, in the command line, cd to the lua directory containing the src directory and type:
make mingw MYCFLAGS="-x c++" CC="g++"
make install INSTALL_TOP=<path>
Replace <path> with whatever you want, just make sure the dynamic library (.dll) and .lib are in the right directories in lib/lua.

GNU:
Run "make" in the build directory

To compile Lua as C++, in a Terminal, cd to the lua directory containing the src directory and type:
make linux MYCFLAGS="-x c++" CC="g++"

Mac OSX (not yet supported, this is for future reference!):
To compile Lua as C++, in a Terminal, cd to the lua directory containing the src directory and type:
make macosx MYCFLAGS="-x c++" MYLDFLAGS="-lc++"
