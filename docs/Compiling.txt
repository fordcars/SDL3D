- To update or recreate the OpenGL Loader, launch glad or go to http://glad.dav1d.de/ (Git: https://github.com/dav1dde/glad-web).
- Include all extensions in the loader :)

- This code uses a number of C++11 features, so make sure your compiler supports them.

- On Linux and Mac, link with -ldl (libdl).

VisualStudio:
- On some VisualStudio versions (for example, 2013-15), compiling in 32-bit, GLM causes an alignment error. To repair this, comment out "#define GLM_HAS_ANONYMOUS_UNION (GLM_LANG & GLM_LANG_CXXMS_FLAG)" at line 675 of glm/detail/setup.hpp.

- On some VisualStudio versions, SDL must be compiled using the same version as the one compiling the game engine. This will fix the unresolved external error. This is because VisualStudio 2015 changed quite a few things.

- Only because some libraries are compiled as Release, and not Debug: 'warning LNK4098: defaultlib 'msvcrt.lib' conflicts with use of other libs; use /NODEFAULTLIB:library 2> -SDL3D.vcxproj -> C:\Users\Carl\Desktop\Development\SDL3D\build\Debug\SDL3D.exe'. Compile program as Release to repair this.
