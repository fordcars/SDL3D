---- Windows ----
Dependencies:
-AMDCompressCLI
-ImageMagik (which includes the required mogrify)

Currently (as of 2015), AMDCompressCLI can't be ran from somewhere else than its installed directory. Because of this, you must paste its directory in SDL3D_DDS_Texture_Compressor.bat at the variable 'compressorExeDirectory'.

ImageMagik's mogrify works fine with running from different places, so when installing ImageMagik, select the option to have it included in your path environment variable (or you can do this manually).

To run the script, simply drag the texture you wish to compress on the batch script. The compressed texture should appear in the same directory as the script.
