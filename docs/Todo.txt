-Load all files at the same place?
-Seperate resources in directories? Textures, objects, etc

-Make blinn-phong lighting -  always specify after the variable in which space it is! (ex: var_modelspace)

-Update to VS 2015 to:
->>Update arrays (uniforms and keys) to std::arrays(VS2012 doesn't supprt list initializations {} so I am keeping normal arrays for now)

-No need of particles, but billboards would be useful for trees, see tutorial 18. Call them sprites.

-Settings class? Include max fps, field of view and aspect ratio

-Lua API?
-Level editor? (specifying textures, probably not shaders)

-3d animations: Either vertex shader or CPU for moving vertices
------------------------------------
-Do something with v-sync like that the frame rate doesn't drop to 30?

-Support events in input and have handleInput() in Game

------------------------------------

-Advanced tutorials:
-VBO Indexing
-2D Text (+2d textures)

FUTURE:
-Dynamic shadows (static shadows are made in 3d modeling program)
