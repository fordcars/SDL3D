-Fix uninitialized read with textured object in misc/FunctionVisualizer/resources/mainBUGGED.lua
-Add to Utils(?) a function to convert from pixels to meters for Lua

-Fix weird crash on Windows that happens sometimes. It happens a few seconds after you quit. I think it is the same bug as below (game stays alive for a while after quitting) and I think it is due to the fact I am forgetting to quit cleanly a certain .dll.
-- Only happens when we load resources?

-To make it faster, use delta instead of multiple steps per frame?
-Give us a way to check if it is the first step of a frame in lua gameStep().

-Definitely try to make it faster CPU wise. Also, when there are a lot of verticies, it slows down A LOT CPU side!

-In PhysicsBody when generating model matrix, make the Box2D angle the actual angle instead of relative to the current rotation of the other axes?

- Lua timer!

- Have a renderAllDebugShapesWithCoords() to relieve the work load from Lua (and usless redraws!)
-Sometimes stays alive for a few seconds (like 10) after quitting?
-In PhysicsBody, render debug shapes at the center of the objects themselves instead of relative to object geometry?

-Ability to create camera with/without physics?
-Give lua access to gravity and have projection instead of hardcoded coords for 2D physics?

-Write a template container and keep those instances instead of a bunch of maps in ResourceManager. Add the ability to duplicate resources in this container!

-Make physics faster by having less steps per frame.

-USE UNIFORM BLOCK FOR LIGHTS?
-Give lightSSSS to shader + don't care about lights that are too far away
- CHECK FOR ONSTATE BEFORE SENDING!
->>> Maybe give mLights to ShadedObject? Shared pointer? Reference?
->>>>>> Uniform block thing: http://www.geeks3d.com/20140704/gpu-buffers-introduction-to-opengl-3-1-uniform-buffers-objects/
->>>>> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7954927/glsl-passing-a-list-of-values-to-fragment-shader

-Don't make uniforms obligatory
-Work on CMake lists to make adding libraries easier and other things.
-Render to texture, so we can have some awesome effects!
-When a C++ error happens (that is caught), crash() it with the Lua line (when it is called from Lua)!
-Give Lua access to input events?

- Use .mtl material files (with ObjectGeometry, check out addObjectGeometryGroup())
->>> .mtl can specify textures!

-A Window class instead of functions in Game? It's fine for now, maybe an SDL window is enough.
-Load all files at the same place?

-Settings class? Include max fps, field of view and resolution
--->> Can the field of view be anything else than numbers power of ten?


-3d animations: Going with mesh keyframes fro now: blender! Export in one .obj per animation. Then interpolate the meshes.
------------------------------------
-Do something with v-sync like that the frame rate doesn't drop to 30?

-Support events for input

------------------------------------

-Advanced tutorials:
-2D Text (+2d textures)

- Transparency

-Dynamic shadows (static shadows are made in 3d modeling program)
