Sadly, the tool currently only works on Windows. On Linux, I recommend using the gimp dds plugin for compressing to dds. Don't forget to vertially flip the texture first, though!

Script depencies:
- AmdCompressCLI
- ImageMagick suite

Currently, to use AmdCompressCLI, you must specify it's path in the script. (check out the compressorExeDirectory variable).
You must add ImageMagick path to your Path environment variable.

To compress a texture, drag-and-drop it over the compression script.

Note: It looks like when you try to compress .png textures that has only a few colors, AMDCompressCLI fails to load the image. This is probably due to some fancy .png optimization I don't know of. To avoid this problem, you can convert your .png to .bmp and compress that file instead.
