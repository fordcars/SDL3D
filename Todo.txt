-Make findShader() work!
-Update() and classes for objects (level, enemy etc)

-Use OpenGL context with shaders and all :)
-3d animations: Either vertex shader or CPU for moving vertices
-Make sure I am including things without #including other files more than once

Only because some libraries are compiled as Release, and not Debug: 'warning LNK4098: defaultlib 'msvcrt.lib' conflicts with use of other libs; use /NODEFAULTLIB:library 2> -SDL3D.vcxproj -> C:\Users\Carl\Desktop\Development\SDL3D\build\Debug\SDL3D.exe'. Compile program as Release to repair this.

Maybe I should of had a Display class? Oh well
