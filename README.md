========

This is a very simple 3D Lua-scriptable game engine using SDL and OpenGL.

Features
--------

- 3D rendering with OpenGL
- Uses SDL
- SDL_mixer sounds
- Box2D physics
- Lua API

Platforms
--------
SDL3D is supported on multiple platforms, but should be compilable on on other platforms without too much work.

- Windows
- Linux (tested on Ubuntu)

Compiling
--------

Check out Compiling.txt.

Additional notes by Phil:
- If you want even simpler compiling instructions, try this:
  - Run CMake
  - Build in your IDE
  - Run it!
- Appears to be no need to do anything that's listed in the Compiling.txt file. 

Roadmap
--------

- Proper rendering engine (render using material files)
- 3D physics?

Support
--------
