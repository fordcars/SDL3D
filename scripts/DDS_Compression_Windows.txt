Script depencies:
- AmdCompressCLI
- ImageMagick suite

Currently, to use AmdCompressCLI, you must specify it's path in the script. (check out the compressorExeDirectory variable).
You must add ImageMagick path to your Path environment variable.

To compress a texture, drag-and-drop it over the compression script.
